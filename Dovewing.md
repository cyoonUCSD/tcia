**Description:** SCP-Dovewing is an artificer and cartographer with the ability to slow time.\
Birth records indicate he was born at the Millefee Hospital in Mousseux, Avignon on Sun's Height 12, 1885.\
His mother was a prostitute who was killed in childbirth by SCP-Trick. His father is unknown. He has a brother, SCP-Trick, that he has a mildly strained relationship with.

Posters and contracts from across Avignon, Ravnica, Thalatas, Narnia, Kozakura, Zhonghua, and Tamna indicate that SCP-Trick travelled often to perform as a celebrity and SCP-Dovewing accompanied him.\
SCP-Dovewing graduated from the University of Ravnica in 1901 with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and from the University of Xuanshi, Zhonghua with a Master's in Mathematics.\
Records from the University of Ravnica and University of Xuanshi, Zhonghua indicate that SCP-Dovewing had above-average intelligence and an aptitude for invention.

SCP-Dovewing was drafted into the Tamnese military on Frostfall 11, 1910.\
Records from the Tamnese Military indicate that SCP-Dovewing was a deserter for philosophical reasons.\
SCP-Dovewing established the Tamnese Antifascist Association and sabotaged multiple Kozakuran gun factories. \
SCP-Dovewing also discovered the rigged elections for government positions and derigged the online system.\
This caused an influx of neutral-pacifist representatives in 1911, contributing to the loss of Tamnese firepower in the war.

SCP-Dovewing is a dangerous terrorist who threatens order with his ability to bend time and his inventions. Though currently neutral with the nation of Tamna, SCP-Dovewing must be watched closely.

**At the end of the war, SCP-Dovewing must be neutralized.**

SCP-Dovewing may be neutralized by taking him by surprise in an empty environment.
