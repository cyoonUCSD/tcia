**Item:** Satja Manoban
**Object Class:** Ranger
**Threat Level:** 4
**Description:** SCP-Thorn is a dangerous sniper. Birth records indicate she was born in the Silver Cat Hospital in Uptown Tamna, Tamna on Second Seed, 1889.\
Her mother succumbed to the plague and her father was killed in the Tamnese-Kozakuran War due to SCP-Solaris's tactical sacrifice. She has a brother, SCP-Hydrogen.

SCP-Thorn and SCP-Zero were in close telescroll contact starting from 1900 to early 1914.\
SCP-Thorn joined the Syuu Clan sometime before Hearthfire 1913.\
SCP-Thorn neutralized Erdene Yurshen on Hearthfire 1913 and SCP-Deagle in 1914.\
SCP-Thorn commissioned SCP-Cloud to assassinate SCP-Deagle and SCP-Scarlet's father, Empress Mikisa Togawa, and the current Tamnese royal family.\
SCP-Cloud rejected the last commission. 

SCP-Thorn is much more dangerous and stealthy than she lets on. SCP-Thorn may be neutralized with movement inhibition, enclosed areas, and melee attacks.
