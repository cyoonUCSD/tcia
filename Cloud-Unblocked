His mother succumbed to tuberculosis and his father was killed by SCP-Solaris.

Between 1903 to 1896, SCP-Solaris's journal entries detail that SCP-Cloud and SCP-Helios were close friends. SCP-Cloud was unaware of the identity of his father's killer until 1903.\
On Rain's Hand 29, 1903, SCP-Cloud escaped the Kyuu Manor.

Registration papers from the Moonlight Orphanage for Troubled Children indicate SCP-Cloud was captured on Sun's Height 6, 1903.\
SCP-Cloud escaped from the orphanage on Sun's Dawn 14, 1906.

SCP-Cloud's belongings suggest he belonged to the Syuu Clan between 1906 to 1914.
Documentation from the Church of Latter Day Yoba indicates SCP-Cloud was baptized on Frostfall 8, 1911.

SCP-Cloud has been confirmed the assassin of SCP-Deagle and SCP-Scarlet's father and Empress Mikisa Togawa. Receipts from the Syuu Clan indicate SCP-Cloud was commissioned by Satja Manoban.

SCP-Cloud shows a dislike for violence now but is still highly dangerous. SCP-Cloud may be neutralized with non-magical movement inhibition.
