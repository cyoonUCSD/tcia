**Description:** SCP-Trick is a rogue with no magical ability.\
Birth records indicate he was born at the Millefee Hospital in Mousseux, Avignon on Sun's Height 12, 1902.\
His mother was a prostitute who was killed in childbirth by SCP-Trick. His father is unknown. He has a brother, SCP-Dovewing, that he has a mildly strained relationship with.

SCP-Trick and SCP-Dovewing were registered to the Millefee Orphanage until their escape in Sun's Height 1906.\
Records from Millefee Prison indicate SCP-Trick was arrested three times between 1906 to 1909.\
Posters and contracts from across Avignon, Ravnica, Thalatas, Narnia, Kozakura, Zhonghua, and Tamna indicate that SCP-Trick travelled often to perform as a celebrity.\
Records from the Tamnese Police Department indicate SCP-Trick was arrested twice between 1912 to 1913.\
Medical records from the Prisoner's Hospital in 1911 indicate SCP-Trick escaped before a facility could diagnose him. 

SCP-Trick was drafted into the Kozakuran military on Frostfall 11, 1912 instead of serving his sentence.\
Records from the Tamnese Military indicate that SCP-Trick was a Kozakuran deserter and instead joined the Tamnese Military under SCP-Solaris.\
SCP-Trick also joined SCP-Dovewing in the Tamnese Antifascist Association and sabotaged multiple Kozakuran gun factories.

SCP-Octane was apprehended by Kozakuran officials at the Yokenen Theater in Hearthfire 1913 along with SCP-Firebolt, SCP-Helios, SCP-Trick, SCP-Deagle, SCP-Scarlet, SCP-Zero, and our current director Thoneh Aawi.

SCP-Trick claims to have magical abilities, but all of SCP-Trick's antics are Sleight of Hand tricks. SCP-Trick is incredibly acrobatic and difficult to pin down.

SCP-Trick may be neutralized by inhibiting his movement and surrounding him until exhaustion.
