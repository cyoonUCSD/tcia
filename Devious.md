**Description:** SCP-Devious is a schizophrenic rogue.\
Birth records indicate he was born at the Drunken Knight Nightclub in Uptown Tamna, Tamna on Midyear 23, 1893.\
Both parents are alive and have a healthy relationship with their son.

SCP-Devious claimed to be the god Sokga on Midyear 23, 1899 after he supposedly looked into all dimensions at all times.\
Medical records from the Golden Cradle Hospital indicate SCP-Devious has a crippling case of ADHD and schizophrenia.\
However, records from his followers state that SCP-Devious was able to look into their pasts accurately and throw parties that would put people into a state of delirious euphoria.\
Multiple eyewitness reports a sudden shift in SCP-Devious's personality in 1909 to become more humble.

SCP-Devious was apprehended by Kozakuran officials in Hearthfire 1913 for tax evasion at the Temple of Sokga, which he had rennovated into a mansion.\
SCP-Devious escaped with SCP-Firebolt, SCP-Helios, SCP-Trick, SCP-Deagle, SCP-Scarlet, SCP-Zero, and our current director Thoneh Aawi.\
The Temple of Sokga was burned down by the Kozakuran government. A new Temple of Sokga, albeit smaller, was rebuilt in Downtown Tamna (Little Cairo).

SCP-Devious shows chaotic tendencies that are amplified by his sense of grandiosity.

SCP-Devious may be neutralized with well-planted distractions such as large unsettling animals or any trap or spell that inhibits SCP-Devious's quick movement. \
**While it is unknown whethewr SCP-Devious is an imposter, a vessel, or a god, SCP-Devious is a powerful religious figure whose followers are numerous and diehard. Any attempts at neutralization should be subtle and appear accidental.**
