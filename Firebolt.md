**Item:** Tio Tapa Togawa\
**Object Class:** Paladin\
**Threat Level:** 4\
**Description:** SCP-Firebolt is a paladin with conflicting motives and origins.\
Birth records and birth date are unable to be found.\
Relation to any family is unknown.\
Geneaology analysis indicates Mexican ancestry and potential familial relation to SCP-Mustang.\

SCP-Firebolt's earliest record is a registration form from Mitori Orphanage in Kanato, Kozakura in Second Seed 19, 1883 as an infant.\
The arrival of infant SCP-Firebolt was by sea in a large Mexican hat alongside a destroyed unreadable note and a bottle of hot sauce.\
Medical records from the orphanage in Second Seed 20, 1883 indicate severe brain damage.\
The next record found was a Kozakuran business license for 308 Kurokawa Ln, Shiroki, Kozakura on Hearthfire 16, 1894 for a hot sauce stand.\
Ship docking logs on Rain's Hand 21, 1912 indicate SCP-Firebolt arrived in Tamna on that day.

Four call logs on Hearthfire, two call logs on Frostfall, and one call log on Sun's Dusk indicate SCP-Firebolt was in contact with the Central Kozakuran Intelligence Agency via face-activated telescroll. 
Seventeen missed calls from the Central Kozakuran Intelligence Agency between Evening Star and Morning Star indicate the loss of contact between SCP-Firebolt and the Central Kozakuran Intelligence Agency.

SCP-Firebolt was apprehended by Kozakuran officials at the Yokenen Theater in Hearthfire 1913 along with SCP-Octane, SCP-Helios, SCP-Trick, SCP-Deagle, SCP-Scarlet, SCP-Zero, and our current director Thoneh Aawi.

SCP-Firebolt had joint legal custody of Ko Masu with SCP-Shelter on Morning Star 29, 1914.

SCP-Firebolt shows a much more docile temperament than he appears to have and is not a violent individual. **Do not attempt to threaten SCP-Firebolt by threatening his friends.**

Though often unintelligent, SCP-Firebolt is difficult to neutralize due to his sheer beefiness. SCP-Firebolt may be neutralized through emotional manipulation or continuous long-ranged and/or airborne bombardment.
