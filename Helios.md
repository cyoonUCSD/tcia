# **SCP-Helios**
**Item:** Ruozhu Kyuu\
**Object Class:** Cleric\
**Threat Level:** 2\
**Description:** SCP-Helios is a mostly harmless cleric of Hasu.\
Birth records indicate she was born in Golden Cradle Hospital in Uptown Tamna, Tamna on Hearthfire 1, 1897.\
Her mother has been killed by SCP-Solaris on Evening Star 25, 1913 and her father is alive. Her relationship to her parents is extremely strained and she has one sibling, SCP-Solaris.

Records from SCP-Helios's private tutors indicate that she was once a very obedient child that grew up to become highly rebellious and interested in masculine activities.\
Her disinterest in feminine activities was noted by many sources around her.

SCP-Solaris's diary entries indicate SCP-Helios was a childhood friend of SCP-Cloud.

SCP-Helios was apprehended by Kozakuran officials at the Yokenen Theater in Hearthfire 1913 along with SCP-Firebolt, SCP-Octane, SCP-Trick, SCP-Deagle, SCP-Scarlet, SCP-Zero, and our current director Thoneh Aawi.

SCP-Helios shows a good deal of both haughtiness and grace to those around her, as well as a desire to prove herself worthy. 

SCP-Helios may be neutralized if taken by surprise and neutralized quickly, before she can take any action. \
**Have a great deal of caution when neutralizing SCP-Helios, as her friends and SCP-Solaris are high-threat biological weapons.**
