# **SCP-Octane**
**Item:** Abydossah Aawi\
**Object Class:** Warlock\
**Threat Level:** 4\
**Description:** SCP-Octane is a highly volatile New Cairan warlock.\
Birth records indicate she was born in Alkhamna Hospital in Downtown Tamna (Little Cairo), Tamna on Midyear 26, 1889.\
Both parents are alive and have a mostly healthy relationship with their daughter aside from mild disapproval of her initial career in dance.

SCP-Octane acquired *The Eye*, a magical flail belonging to The Eye, the demon servant of Miruk, at an auction in Uptown Tamna (Renaissance Street), Tamna on First Seed 13, 1906.\
It is unclear if SCP-Octane is aware of her patron.

SCP-Octane was apprehended by Kozakuran officials at the Yokenen Theater in Hearthfire 1913 along with SCP-Firebolt, SCP-Helios, SCP-Trick, SCP-Deagle, SCP-Scarlet, SCP-Zero, and our current director Thoneh Aawi.

SCP-Octane shows violent tendencies that are amplified by her weapon. **Great deal of caution must be used when separating SCP-Octane from The Eye for longer than 20 minutes.**

SCP-Octane may be neutralized with either well-timed reflective counter-attacks or with the help of multiple allies, as she is highly limited by her stamina and cannot fight long battles. **Do not attempt to neutralize SCP-Octane alone.**
